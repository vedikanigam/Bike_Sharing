# Bike_Sharing

## Overview of the Analysis
This project analyses NYC citibike data for August 2019 to understand how a bike sharing program works and then use the results to create a proposal for a similar bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create visualizations that convey information about citibike users and their usage patterns to deduce conclusions for a similar program in Des Moines. Using Tableau, we will create a story about biketrip data in New York City.

## Results

### Bike Usage
The customer type pie chart indicates that annual subscribers use the bikes more often than users who are not subscribers. 
The gender breakdown chart shows that the bike sharing proram is more popular among males.

It could be that the bikes are being used for morning and evening commute by users going to work. Saturday seems to be a popular day for citibike usage. It is possible that tourists visiting the city during the weekend are using bikes for sightseeing.

## Summary 
From the visualizations, it can be concluded that bike usage is higher among males who are annual subscribers and popular times are morning and evening commutes and weekends. 
 
### Recommendations
A similar breakdown by age will give us insights into the age groups that prefer using citibikes. Also, plotting the data by months and seasons will reveal what times of the year are popular for citi bike usage.
