## Overview of the Analysis
This project analyses NYC citibike data for August 2019 to understand how a bike sharing program works and then use the results to create a proposal for a similar bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create visualizations that convey information about citibike users and their usage patterns to deduce conclusions for a similar program in Des Moines. Using Tableau, we will create a story about biketrip data in New York City.

## Results

### Bike Usage
The customer type pie chart indicates that annual subscribers use the bikes more often than users who are not subscribers. 
The gender breakdown chart shows that the bike sharing proram is more popular among males.

### Checkout Times for Users
This chart shows that maximum number of bikes are checked out for atleast 5 minutes. A majority of bikes are checked out for 30 minutes. The number drastically reduces after the first hour.

### Checkout Times by Gender
The breakdown of the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender reveals that males are using the bikes in higher proportion than females and other users.

### Trips by Weekday Per Hour
This heatmap shows the number of bikes trips by weekday for each hour of the day. Most of the bikes are checked out between 8 am and 9 am in the morning and between 5 pm and 7 pm in the evening. It could be that the bikes are being used for morning and evening commute by users going to work. Saturday seems to be a popular day for citibike usage. It is possible that tourists visiting the city during the weekend are using bikes for sightseeing.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per hour)
This heatmap illustrates the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week. Again, the popular times are between 8 am and 9 am and between 5 pm and 7 pm. The popular weekday appears to be Thursday and frequency of use among males is higher in comparison to females and other unknown users.

## Summary 
From the visualizations, it can be concluded that bike usage is higher among males who are annual subscribers and popular times are morning and evening commutes and weekends. 
 
### Recommendations
A similar breakdown by age will give us insights into the age groups that prefer using citibikes. Also, plotting the data by months and seasons will reveal what times of the year are popular for citi bike usage.
